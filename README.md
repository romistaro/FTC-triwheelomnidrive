# FTC-triwheelomnidrive
This is the thought process and code behind the designing of the robot for J. Clarke Richardsons 2022 FTC robot pictured below.

The robot would need three wheels, each spaced roughly 120 degrees apart in a triangular drivetrain.

the joystick input for this robot would have both an x and y coordinate, positive x indicating left, and positive y indicating up, this is how the ftc control hub interprets them.

In the diagram shown below, the front of the drivetrain is considered between wheels one and two, which is subsequently where I placed the wheel posistions for it on the x,y plane

Calculating the power needed for each wheel if the robot was to be moved straight forward (assuming the flat end between wheel one and two was the front, could be done as follows.

<ul>
  <li>calculate the angle between the desired direction of travel and the desired wheels (x) position relative to the center of the drivetrain</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
